This is an online platform that enables students to buy and sell seconded-handed books among themselves.

In seller mode, students can post their books' information and image,
set price tag, and set post period. All the books that have been posted can be browsed.
status can be changed to 'sold' on books that have already been sold, so buyers can no longer send buying requests.

In buying mode, students can see books that have been posted on chronological order.
There is a search function to search for books according to name, writer, ISBN, price range and etc.
When interested in a book, a request can be made on that particular book, 
and notification will be sent to seller via email and in the notification function on the website itself.
